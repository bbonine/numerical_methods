Good afternoon James,

Here's a quick guide to everything in this assignment:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TARBALL CONTENTS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-homework_1.pdf: Type set explanation of my solution to the problems


-src: Folder housing the source code for all problems in the assignment.

		-prob_1
			-quad_1.cpp: Standalone solver for problem 1

		-prob_2
			-quad_2.cpp: Main program from problems 2 and 3 (mostly just print statements).
			-function_2.cpp: Separate file containing function definitions
			-quad_2.h: header file 

		-prob_4
			-quad_3.cpp: Main program from problems 2 and 3. Pretty much a copy of quad_2.cpp
			-function_3.cpp: Separate file containing  function definitions
			-quad_3.h: header file


-makefile






----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the code, simply input "make" into the terminal while in the parent directory. The makefile should
point to the correct source code folders. The makefile should generate an executable in the parent directory
for each problem. If everything is working right, you should end up with "quad_1", "quad_2", and "quad_3" which can be run
by simply typing "./quad_n", where n is the number associated with the program you would like to run.

All programs will require raw input. As suggested in the typeset solutions, you can use a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6
for a quick check of the program accuracy.


If this file structure is a little tedious for you to grade, just  let me know and I'll change it up next time!
